      <h3>Hey there, I'm Waverly!</h3>
      <p>I'm a strategist by trade, a creator at heart, and a human being on a mission to make this world a slightly better place. </p>

      <p>I believe that it is possible to create a net-positive impact in this world when we design, build, and think about problems with humanity's best interests in mind. How else can we solve the world's "wicked" problems?</p>

      <p>Through studying the drivers of behavioral change, decision making processes, and identity formation from the lenses of media consumption, culture, and human interactions, I help teams create holistic, personable, human-dignifying experiences, products, and services. </p>
