      <h3>Hey there, I'm Waverly!</h3>
      <p>I am a strategy consultant by trade, a creative DIY-er/maker at heart, and ultimately, a human being on a mission to transform this world into a better place. </p>

      <p>I believe that it is possible to create a net-positive impact in this world when we start thinking, designing, and building with people in mind. This might be the only way to truly address society’s wicked problems. </p>

      <p>But there is a gap between doing what is easy, financially beneficial, and socially just. </p>

      <p>Through studying the drivers of behavioral change, decision making processes, and identity formation from the lenses of media consumption, culture, human interactions, and digital experiences, I draw insights on how we can create holistic, personable, human-dignifying experiences, products, and services. </p>

      <p><b>We each have a role to play. I’m excited to see how we can build a better world, together.</b> </p>
