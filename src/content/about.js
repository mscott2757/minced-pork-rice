     /* <p>What do people want, how much do they need it, and what will they do to get it? The role I currently play is all about breaking down the complex into the comprehensible through user research and visual design. It’s about creating spaces for conversation from diverse perspectives through events and workshops. It’s about reconciling the seemingly dichotomous: structure and creativity, feelings and data, for-profit and social good, legacy and innovation. </p>

      <p>From mapping external trends to user pain points, to facilitating design sessions, to reconciling the conflicting needs of different personas, I have discovered new ways to onboard customers, influence corporate executive culture, and create painless recruitment experiences.</p> */

      <h3>Hey there, I'm Waverly!</h3>
      <p>I am an innovation strategist by trade, a creative DIY-er/maker at heart, and ultimately, a human being on a mission to transform this world into a better place. </p>

      <p>I believe that when we gather together with a genuine intent to create something good in this world, we are able to build beautiful and authentic experiences. This may be the only way to truly solve society’s wicked problems. </p>

      <p>But there is a gap. There is a gap between doing what is financially beneficial, and what is socially right. </p>

      <p>Through studying the drivers of behavioral changes, decision making processes, and identity formation from the lenses of media consumption, culture, human interactions, and digital experiences, I draw insights on how we can create holistic, personable, human-dignifying experiences, products, and services. </p>

      <p><b>We each have a role to play. I’m excited to see how we can build a better world, together.</b> </p>
