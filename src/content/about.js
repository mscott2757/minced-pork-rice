      <h3>Hey there, I'm Waverly!</h3>
      <p>I am a strategy consultant by trade, a creative DIY-er/maker at heart, and ultimately, a human being on a mission to transform this world into a better place. </p>

      <p>I believe that it is possible to create a net-positive impact in this world when we design, build, and think about problems with humanity's best interests in mind. Maybe that's the only way we can truly address society’s wicked problems. </p>

      <p>Through studying the drivers of behavioral change, decision making processes, and identity formation from the lenses of media consumption, culture, human interactions, and digital experiences, I draw insights on how we can create holistic, personable, human-dignifying experiences, products, and services. </p>

      <p><b>We each have a role to play. I’m excited to see how we can build a better world, together.</b> </p>
