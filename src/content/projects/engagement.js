  <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>The innovation lab serves as an internal agency and consultancy for our internal clients, the many lines of business (LOB) that make up our company. We drive product innovation for our clients and primarily focus on "Horizon 3" transformational ideas looking 3–5 years out. As a result, a majority of our projects end as POCs and do not immediately go into production. </p>

    <p>My team owns the intake process for a majority of our product innovation engagements. Before we work on any engagement with a client, we must first understand their priorities so that we can better define the problem(s), facilitate ideation, and develop initial ideas into a mature idea, ultimately creating a POC for testing. </p>

    <p>The legacy engagement model heavily relied on clients knowing the right people and "phoning-a-friend" to get a project started. As a result, projects with potential for high value and impact might not have been allocated resources simply because that team did not know the "right" people. Our team was chartered with creating and implementing a more streamlined, judicious process. We had 2 areas of focus: create an equitable and intuitive engagement model and increase the integrity of the project prioritization process.</p>

    <h3>The Team</h3>
    <p>I have been working on this engagement experience redesign with <b>a senior strategist and a senior VP</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Solution​</h3>
    <p>Using information from our existing workflows, ethnographic interviews, and a workshop, I created a couple of different visualizations to help the team have a more holistic understanding of the current process, the key players, and bottlenecks. This understanding allowed us to make key strategic changes to improve SLA performance, validate project prioritization with data, and improve transparency of reporting and project statuses.</p>

    <p>We have been in the process of standing up the following:</p>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>A client engagement portal, a one stop shop for clients to share their ideas and needs with us prior to kicking off projects</li>
    <li>Engagement leaders, who manage the inflow of ideas and map them to LOB, department, and enterprise priorities</li>
    <li>New KPIs that keep the team accountable to SLAs and closing communication gaps</li>
    <li>Business value assessment "scorecards" that quantify the value and impact to more effectively prioritize resources</li>
    <li>Project portfolio platform for improved transparency on statuses of existing and upcoming projects in the pipeline</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

        <ProjectImg src='p1_boxes'/>

    <p>The above visualization shows how reliant LOB partners have been on knowing the right people to initiate engagements with the innovation lab. There are multiple points of contact and no clear communication channel. Teams within the innovation lab are sometimes unaware of conversations happening with other groups. </p>

        <ProjectImg src='p1_funnel'/>

    <p>This visualization shows where initial ideas come from and how they are developed to a point of maturity and readiness for a POC test. The graduation criteria for how an idea can move on from one stage to the next have been operationalized, but the success metrics are still being developed. What % of ideas should drop off at each stage? What is a healthy number of ideas to convert into POC tests?</p>

    <p>This diagram takes a look at the team's desired engagement model. It's a living document that can be iterated upon as we discover more optimal ways to deliver our services.</p>



    <h3>​Our Approach</h3>
    <p>We knew that our process wasn't always going as planned, but we didn't yet have a full understanding of the entire process. How were our clients interacting with our team vs. other teams in our department? How did they want to engage with us? What was the most effective way to engage with them? </p>

    <p>We conducted a series of ethnographic interviews with key stakeholders from the 6 main teams of our innovation lab to gain a better understanding of existing pain points internal to how our department was structured. Another important input was client feedback.</p>


    <b>​Insights</b>
    <p></p>
    <p>Some of the insights that came from our synthesis include…</p>

    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>There was a lack of clarity on how to officially kick off a new engagement due to client's reliance on "phoning-a-friend". Some clients perceived the new "official" engagement process as potentially slower, clunky, and bureaucratic.</li>
    <li>Inconsistent SLA performance made some clients feel cared for and others forgotten, hurting the brand perception of the innovation lab to our LOB partners. This was especially true for projects that were "leapfrogged" to the front of the queue due to personal relations. </li>
    <li>Without a "playbook," clients' understanding of the entire suite of services was disjointed and depended on who they knew and what they had heard before, resulting in mismatched expectations.
    </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>These insights drove the creation of the above strategic initiatives, which are in the process of being stood up today.</p>
