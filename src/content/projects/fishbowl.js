      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>In the spring semester of my senior year, I got the opportunity to film and produce a short film that critically analyzed and reflected upon Asian/Asian American representation in media.</p>

        <h4>How might we ignite a conversation on the role of Asian Americans in media and the challenges each individual faces in telling their story?</h4>
      </Quote>

      <h3>PROCESS</h3>

      <p>Throughout the semester, we had been watching a variety of films to better contextualize and understand the historical progression of Asian representation in media. Our research came from a variety of sources, including Youtube channels produced by Asian Americans, full-length movies, and class readings. We also interviewed our peers to better understand their perspectives.</p>

      <p>Over the course of a month of script writing, filming, and producing, we created Fish Bowl. It is a twist on the TV show Shark Tank. In this short film, we take a closer look at some of the reasons why Asian Americans are represented the way they are, and the narratives we are trying to share.</p>
