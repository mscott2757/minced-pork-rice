      <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>How might we ignite a conversation on the role of Asian Americans in media and the challenges each individual faces in telling their story?</p>

      <h3>PROCESS</h3>

      <p>Throughout the semester, we had been watching a variety of films to better contextualize and understand the historical progression of Asian representation in media. Our research came from a variety of sources, including Youtube channels produced by Asian Americans, full-length movies, and class readings. We also interviewed our peers to better understand their perspectives.</p>

      <p>Over the course of a month of script writing, filming, and producing, we created Fish Bowl. It is a twist on the TV show Shark Tank. In this short film, we take a closer look at some of the reasons why Asian Americans are represented the way they are, and the narratives we are trying to share.</p>
