  <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p>
    Hiring the right people is a huge challenge for companies. Companies want to add fresh talent to their teams, but may be hesitant to bring on new grads who lack experience and have unrealistic expectations of their first job.</p>

    <p>Our West Coast team missed the deadline to participate at local university career fairs for that hiring season. Not having a presence at these fairs could potentially decrease the pool of applicants, making it even more difficult to attract and hire top talent.
    </p>

    <p>What started off as a problem became an opportunity to try something new. In an impromptu brainstorm, I brought up how prevalent company-sponsored case competitions and hackathons were when I was attending UC Berkeley. This type of event would be a great way for our team to socialize our company and identify potential new hires despite missing this year's deadlines.
    </p>

    <p>Co-hosting with student orgs would be an even better way to connect with the students and understand their perspectives on recruitment. <b>What we ended up with was 2 all-day "design-a-thons" and a fresh class of new hires directly from the event. </b>
    </p>

    <h3>The Team</h3>
    <p>I worked with <b>3 other strategists</b> over the course of <b>5 weeks</b> to redesign our team's recruitment process. We had additional support from a larger team of senior consultants and business analysts on the day of our recruitment events.
    </p>

    <h3>Solution​</h3>
    <p>Through a co-creation process with the student leaders, we designed and hosted a one-day design-a-thon at 2 local campuses. The design-a-thon was a blend of a business case competition with a heavy focus on human centered design (HCD) and design strategy skills. 
    </p>
    <p>The first half of the day was all about building rapport and introducing new skills while the second half was focused on applying the newly learned skills in a business case. 
    </p>

    <p>We had exposure to 1000+ students with 150+ signs up and 80 final applicants. Select participants were extended opportunities to interview and received offers. </p>

    <h3>​OurApproach</h3>
    <b>​Discovery</b> 
    <p></p>
    <p>We knew we had a bit of research to do before we could start planning the event. We first reached out to student organizations at local Bay Area universities, utilizing our alumni network. We conducted ethnographic interviews with student leaders at the different campuses to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Understand what students wanted from their first job/internship
      </li>
      <li>Define success by understanding a student perspective on recruitment </li>
      <li>Validate the interest and effectiveness of this type of event
      </li>
    </ol>


    <b>​Building Empathy</b>
        <p></p>
    <p>After our initial outreach, we identified key student leaders and organizations as potential event co-hosts. We introduced human centered design concepts to the student leaders by hosting a mini Design Thinking (DT) session. We used DT frameworks to build empathy, ideate, prototype, and quickly test and validate the concept of a desgin-a-thon. 
    </p>

    <p>We walked away from the session with insights on how students felt about recruitment (<i>anxious, unconfident</i>), what they were concerned about (<i>first impressions, "business speak," applying theory to practice</i>), their career dreams (<i>vast and varied</i>), and long-term goals (<i>for many, an ambiguous question mark</i>).

    <b>Problem Statement</b>
        <p></p>
    <p>We developed the following HMW statement from the learnings in our initial DT sessions:</p>

    <Quote><h4>H​ow might we engage students in a recruiting experience that will build up their confidence and give us an opportunity to build a relationship before they ever set foot in the company?​</h4></Quote>

    <b>The Design-a-thon</b>
        <p></p>
    <p>We used the mini DT sessions as a prototype for the structure of the Design-a-thon itself. Our learnings taught us how important it was to empower students during the recruitment process. We sought to do this through teaching the students a new skill to their toolbox, human centered design, by teaching the DT mindset and framework. </p>

    <p>Our Design-a-thon agenda looked a little like this: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>8:00–9:00 am</b> <i>Coffee, coffee, and more coffee</i> - We played music to get everyone pumped up, and set up our physical space to encourage collaboration. (It helped that we were already in a classroom.)</li>
      <li><b>9:00–9:30 am</b> - <i>Sign in, intros and icebreakers</i> - Creating a fun, comfortable environment was imperative to building rapport between us and the team, but also amongst the students. We had many participants join who were not necessarily affiliated with the student orgs we partnered with. </li>
      <li><b>9:30–10:00 am</b> <i>Breaking off into teams</i> - We had asked students to take a Personality Poker assessment and submit their results prior to the Design-a-thon. We used their "suit" to create more balanced teams. We kicked off the day with the marshmallow spaghetti tower challenge to help groups gel more quickly. </li>
      <ProjectImg src='marsh1'/>
      <li><b>10:00–12:30pm</b> <i>Intro to HCD</i> - We led a DT workshop and walked through the different phases of the DT framework, with interactive exercises for students to practice ethnographic interviewing, create personas, and build out customer journeys.</li>
      <li><b>12:30–1:00pm</b> <i>Pizza lunch break!</i> - Great time for our team of strategists, business analysts, and senior principals to mingle with the students.</li>
      <li><b>1:00–3:00pm</b> <i>Pokémon Go business case</i> - We created a business case inspired by the hype and decline of Pokémon Go, an AR mobile gaming app. We structured the case in such a way that the DT skills from earlier in the day would play an important part in creating a strong presentation. We provided resources, such as quotes and insights, from our team's pre-work of ethnographic interviews of active and potential Pokémon Go players.  </li>
     
    <ProjectImg src='thinking'/>

      <li><b>3:00–4:00pm</b> <i>Final presentations and awards</i> - Each of the teams presented the results of their case study. Our team assessed each of the presentations based off of the novelty of each team's idea, the team's overall public speaking capabilities, and the thoughtfulness of their case. Candidates that stood out during the presentation and from our interactions throughout the day were extended opportunities for an on-site interview. 
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Takeaways​</h3> 
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Will you choose to look at the glass half empty, or half full? This experience taught me to see business restrictions and legacy business models as opportunities to challenge the status quo and experiment with new ideas. </li>
      <li>Co-creation looked a bit different with each of the student orgs we worked with. Some student leaders were much more involved in the planning process while others were unsure how to support the efforts. We had to stay nimble to adapt to the needs of a diverse student body.</li>
      <li>When one of us wins, we all win. As cliché as that may sound, I learned how important it was for me, a fairly recent grad and a newer member of the workforce, to be an advocate for the students. Recruitment can often be a demoralizing experience for students and a potentially inefficient usage of time for employees.This experience showed me how I could play a role in bridging that gap. </li>
    </ol>
