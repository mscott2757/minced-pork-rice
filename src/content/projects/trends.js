    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>We partnered with internal digital and innovation groups to host an in-person and virtual workshop with 20+ participants, centered around a simple question within the context of the financial industry. </p>

    <h4>How might we best inspire our customers to fall in love with our digital channels?</h4></Quote>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>In our workshop, we used an outside-in approach and took a look at emerging consumer trend signals outside of the financial industry. We used these trends to set context for our ideation session. Some of these trend themes and signals included: </p>

    <ol>
    <li>Photo moments</li>
    <li>“Entertainment-ization” of product</li>
    <li>Being big, acting small</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We mapped our ideas to some of the most prominent customer experience pain points across multiple product customer journeys. Following the workshop, we had 2 weeks of synthesizing our 90+ ideas into themes and opportunity areas. </p>

    <p>In this process, we found that there was actually a gap between the identified pain points, and the actual pain points our ideas solved for. We found that the identified pain points were often feature and function-focused, while our ideation session produced ideas that solved for emotional pain points. Before our customer could fall in love with our digital channels and have these emotional needs met, we first had to establish the foundation of our customer’s respect. </p>

    <p>The team came away with 5 opportunity areas and conducted an initial prioritization exercise within these areas based upon their perceived value and difficulty level in solving for the identified gaps. We are excited to explore new and existing services, products, and spaces across these opportunity areas. </p>

     <h3>Design Challenges & Takeaways</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>One of the challenges we faced was finding the right combination of people, teams, and executive sponsorship - in other words, those who would benefit most from attending our workshop. </li>
        <li>At the start of our workshop, we found that our participants had different definitions for digital onboarding and because of this, held different expectations for the objective of the workshop. We had hoped to address this with the brief pre-read package we sent out a week prior. </li>
        <li>It is fun and engaging to wear different hats! As we further develop our project strategy roadmap, we have shifted away from workshop facilitation and towards pitching and presenting our workshop outcome.
