    <h3>T​he Project​</h3>
<p>How does a company recover from  multiple hits to its brand? As a strategist in our innovation lab, which tests concepts 3–7 years out, our department was far removed from the banking services scandals that had hit our bank over the past year. And yet, team morale was incredibly low. 
</p><p>
Our team decided to host a workshop in an efforts to uplift overall morale. We invited product teams from different parts of the bank to answer one question: <b>How do we rebuild our brand to inspire our customers to fall in love with us again?</b></p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>I worked with a team of 2 other strategists over the course of <b>6 weeks</b> to design a workshop, facilitate the activities on the day of, and create post-workshop deliverables. We had support from 4 additional team members who helped on the day of with room set up, virtual attendee experience, illustrated notes, and public note taking. </p>

<h3>Solution​</h3>
<p>We hosted a half day workshop that covered trends, pain points, and ideation. We spent around 2-3 weeks planning the session (from idea to agenda!) and roughly 2–3 weeks synthesizing content, which included a final read-out session and digital report out. </p>

<h3>Our Approach​</h3>
<b>Pre-work</b>
<p></p>
<p>Prior to workshop, we had been doing "trend briefings" inspired by Sparks&Honey. We found that taking an outside-in approach and looking at trends outside the financial industry were great ways to spark conversations within our team about what was happening outside of banking. We used these discussions to create more empathy and understanding of how external trends might affect the way people felt about and used their money. </p>

<b>The Plan</b><p></p>
<p>We took this trends practice and mashed it together with our more traditional approach to ideation. We focused specifically on the customer onboarding process and looked into pain points along their onboarding journey. We defined onboarding to include all of the touchpoints where a customer learns about, relates to, considers, and takes action.</p>


<p>We spent time speaking with different teams to understand how their product or process might directly impact customer sentiment. We took a deep dive into different user journeys that make up the larger customer onboarding process, and identified the biggest pain points. Some of these user journeys included the digital account open process, adding on additional financial services, and learning about financial health management. </p>
<p>
We selected our attendees intentionally to cover a wider breadth of teams and break down traditional working silos. These teams included the ATM team, retail branch team, innovation lab teams, and mobile app team. While a majority of our attendees were able to participate at our San Francisco office, we made the decision to build out a digital experience too so that out-of-state attendees could participate virtually. </p>

<b>The Workshop</b><p></p>
<p>We kicked off the day with coffee and pastries. We introduced our team and set context on our problem statement and what we wanted to accomplish. Our agenda looked a little something like this:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><b>8:30–9:00 am</b> Set up, coffee, and pastries </li>
<li><b>9:00–9:15 am</b> Welcome and introductions </li>
<li><b>9:15–9:40 am</b> Customer journey pain points </li>
<li><b>9:40–10:20 am</b> Trends discussion and ideation </li>
<li><b>10:20–10:40 am</b> Affinity mapping </li>
<li><b>10:40–11:00 am</b> Wrap up </li>
</ul></p>

<b>The Synthesis</b><p></p>
<p>After the workshop, our team spent time synthesizing the content from 90+ ideas. We start off our process by cataloguing the ideas and labeling them with the pain points that they were mapped to. Often time, the ideas that come out of these types of sessions are not always fully baked, so we spend time distilling the idea to the kernel of the thought and adding on to the initial idea to create a higher quality, more thoughtful one. </p>
<p>In this process, we found that there was actually a gap between the identified pain points, and the actual pain points our ideas solved for. We found that the biggest customer pain points were feature and function-focused, while the ideas the participants came up with solved for emotional pain points. </p>

<p>We then create an affinity map of the ideas and bucket similar ones into clusters. We use our clusters to identify larger themes, ultimately leading to broader opportunity areas for the team to explore new business models, products, and services in. </p>

<p>We came away with 5 opportunity areas and conducted an initial prioritization exercise within these areas using an Impact-Effort matrix.We presented an overview of the workshop and our synthesis to the participants, who took our report out back to their teams. </p>

<p>At the end of this project, we realized we had found an answer to our question. Before our customer could fall in love with our digital channels and have these emotional needs met, we first had to establish the foundation of our customer's respect. </p>


<h3>T​akeaways​</h3>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>In an effort to make our workshop inclusive, we decided to create both an in-person and virtual experience. Even with a virtual audience advocate moderating the experience and controlling the position of our video cameras, it was incredibly difficult to create a consistent experience for virtual attendees as there was a lot of in-person collaboration. </li>
  <li>Having a diverse set of participants was extremely exciting and gave us a glimpse of what it looked like to break down legacy silos - but also meant that the ownership post-workshop could easily fall through the cracks. While we had support from senior stakeholders from the different teams, we did not have executive sponsorship from every single team. This made it difficult to keep participants accountable for following through on the ideas that came from the session. </li>
  <li>Set the right expectations. Before we held our workshop, we found that our participants used different nomenclature to describe similar things, and the same taxonomy to describe different things. Because of this, participants had different expectations of the workshop's objective. We addressed this by including a pre-read package sent a week prior to the workshop and creating time during our intros to address any remaining concerns.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to have fun! When you spend so much time with your team, it's important to enjoy each other's company. Our team acted as a mini boutique consultancy and wore a lot of different hats throughout this project. Things weren't always smooth, but our relationships grew a lot during this time.</li>
